### [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/kaminiravichandran/credit-card-fraud-final)
Throughout the financial sector, machine learning algorithms are being developed to detect fraudulent transactions. In this project I used the dataset from Kaggle which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders. I used python to predict if a transaction was credit card fraud. For confidentiality reasons only 2 variables were exposed and I used those to detect traces of fraud. I Trained the algorithm to detect the outlier (which is the fraud). Finally, I was able to detect 30% of fraud transactions correctly and 71 out of 28500 as fraud which is 2% of fraud which is a small amount. But If we are able to implement this in a company we can reduce the credit card fraud and save money for the company.


### [Breast Cancer Detection](https://github.com/kaminiravichandran/Breast-Cancer-Detection)
For this project I used the Original Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database collected in 1992-07-15 which contains characteristics of cells nucleii for breast cancer prediction. There were 11 variables, like mitosis, cell size and cell shape that I used to detect malignant cancer or benign cancer. I trained the algorithms KNN and SVM to detect breast cancer with 96% accuracy. I found out that with increase in mitosis and cell size there was higher chance of malignant cancer than benign cancer. This machine learning algorithm can be implemented in hospitals to help doctors detect cancer simply by inputing the values for the variables.


### [Hotel Marketing Case Study](https://github.com/kaminiravichandran/Hotel-Marketing-Case-Study)
The data was for a hotel marketing campaign. I had to quantify the key features impacting the performance of Net Room Nights in the dataset. There were 87,000 rows of data and 10 features like, which platform(mobile or web), which website, the no. of visits to web, the no. of total orders. I trained the linear regression model to be able to predict the net room nights given the other parameters with an accuracy of 98%. I found that it would be better to invest in marketing campaigns especially towards Airbnb desktop customers during the months of may to august as it was summer holiday time and the hotel business is thriving.


### [House Prices Detection & Mobile Prices Classification](https://github.com/kaminiravichandran/Machine-Learning)

House Prices Detection: For this project, I pulled the dataset from Kaggle which consists of house prices from King County an area in the US State of Washington, between May 2014 to May 2015. Hence, it was a regression problem. The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 21613 observations. I trained several Machine Learning models and found that the best machine learning model for this dataset is linear regression with perfect train and test score, however considering all the scenarios model which works the best is the ridge with aplha value 150.

Mobile Prices Classification: For this project, I pulled the dataset from Kaggle which consists of data of mobile phones of various companies. Using this data the goal was to be able to classify a suitable mobile price range based on several variables like RAM,Internal Memory, battery power, etc.  The dataset consisted of 21 variables and 2000 observations. I trained several Machine learning models and found that the best model for classification dataset is the Support Vector Classifier with linear Kernel and C value as 1.


### [Diabetes Onset Detection](https://github.com/kaminiravichandran/Diabetes-Onset-Detection)
For this project, I pulled the dataset from the UCI Repository where all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The dataset consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Class. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on. In this project, I will be depicting the usage of the scikit-learn grid search capability to diagnostically classify whether the patient has diabetes or not with 78% accuracy.
